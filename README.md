# PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the
business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.
The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they
get out of hand. The CHRO, Mr Yunus Shofoluwe, has been assigned the task to identify
key areas within the business that could give rise to issues and address them immediately.
Mr Shofoluwe decided to recruit you as an HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s
HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention. “Now, the
future of gender equality in Palmoria lies in your hands” – the exact words of Mr
Shofoluwe before he handed the data to you

## OBJECTIVES
To analyze HR data to discover potential gender disparities in the organization particularly in salary distribution, departmental representation, performance ratings, and bonus allocation  and provide insights to support equitable HR policies.
